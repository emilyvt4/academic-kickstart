# About me

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Policy Analysis and Management at Cornell University, with a concentration in Sociology and minor in Demography. My research is primarily concerned with how health and social policies have evolved in the U.S. and how they affect peopleâ€™s lives. I also study modern American union formation and changing gender norms in the contexts of work and family.

My dissertation examines the Community Health Center (CHC) program, a widespread safety net program serving more than 29 million Americans in more than 10,000 medically underserved communities nationwide. I use a mixed-methods approach to study this institution through combining three original data collection efforts: (1) the geographic location of health centers from 1965-2018, (2) in-depth interviews with health center patients and providers, and (3) primary documents from presidential archives on the political history of CHCs as compared with Medicaid.

My dissertation research has received support from the Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy, the Fahs Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation, the Cornell Center for the Study of Inequality, and the Cornell Office of Engagement Initiatives.
