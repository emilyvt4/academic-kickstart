# About me

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Policy Analysis and Management at Cornell University, with a concentration in Sociology and minor in Demography.

My dissertation explores  Community Health Centers (CHCs), a safety net program providing primary care for more than 28 million Americans who are predominantly low-income. I use a mixed-methods approach to studying this institution through combining historical, administrative, and archival data, as well as in-depth interviews with CHC patients and providers. This research has been funded by the Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy, the Fahs Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation, the Cornell Center for the Study of Inequality, and the Cornell Office of Engagement Initiatives.
