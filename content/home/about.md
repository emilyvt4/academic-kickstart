# About me

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Policy Analysis and Management at Cornell University, with a concentration in Sociology and minor in Demography. My research is primarily concerned with the evolution, experiences, and effects of U.S. health and social policies. I also study modern American union formation and changing gender norms in the contexts of family life as well as work.

My dissertation focuses on the Community Health Center (CHC) program, which provides primary care—regardless of ability to pay—for more than 29 million Americans who are predominantly low-income. I use a mixed-methods approach to study this federally funded institution:

•	To analyze spatial variation in who can access CHCs, I created an original dataset containing the geographic location of every CHC site from its origins in 1965 through 2018.

•	To understand how the CHC program addresses poverty in the communities they serve, I am collecting in-depth interviews with health center patients and providers.

•	Finally, I am conducting a comparative historical analysis using primary documents from eight presidential archives to examine how CHCs have been able to avoid political controversy, unlike Medicaid.

My dissertation research has received support from the Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy, the Fahs Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation, the Cornell Center for the Study of Inequality, and the Cornell Office of Engagement Initiatives.
