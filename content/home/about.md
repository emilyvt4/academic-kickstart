# About me

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Policy Analysis and Management at Cornell University, with a concentration in Sociology and minor in Demography. My dissertation explores Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), a safety net institution providing primary care for more than 28 million Americans who are predominantly low-income. I use a mixed-methods approach to studying this institution through combining historical administrative and archival data, as well as in-depth interviews with FQHC patients and providers.
